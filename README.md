# VirtualMachine
I created this Virtual Machine as part of the Nand2Tetris course (https://www.nand2tetris.org/). In the course you develop a virtual computer (the Hack-Computer) starting from only NAND-Gates. Then you write an assembler, a virtual machine, a compiler and a simple operating system for this computer.
